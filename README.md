# Redistricting Dual Bounds for Optimal Representation
 This code repository houses code for the paper "Dual Bounds for Redistricting Problems with Non-Convex Objectives" by J. Fravel, R. Hildebrand,  N. Goedert, L. Travis, and M. Pierson.  See https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17298.
 
 Go to the folder DualBounds-Example to find an example file Example.ipynb for running code.

 This code is largely forked from the python code for the paper "Political districting to minimize cut edges" by Hamidreza Validi and Austin Buchanan, and the repository can be found here: https://github.com/hamidrezavalidi/Political-Districting-to-Minimize-Cut-Edges.

 The other folder contains some miscellaneous code for data downloading from Redistricting Data Hub, data cleaning, and a number of other scripts.
